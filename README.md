# About

Adds the `notpwned:min` validation rule to check values against the [HaveIBeenPwned Pwned Passwords](https://haveibeenpwned.com/Passwords) service using the ranged search (k-anonymity) feature for privacy & security. If a value has been pwned more than `:min` (1 by default) times, then the provided value will fail validation.

# Documentation

## Limiting by the number of times the password was pwned

You can limit rejected passwords to those that have been pwned a minimum number of times.
For example, `password` has been pwned 3,303,003 times, however `P@ssword!` has only been pwned 118 times.
If we wanted to block `password` but not `P@ssword!`, we can specify the minimum number as 150 like this:

```php
'password' => 'required|string|min:6|notpwned:150|confirmed',
```

## Enforce this rule on Backend authentication

To enforce this rule on the Backend authentication system, create a file at `config/winter/pwnedpasswords/config.php` and put the following in it:

```php
<?php return [

    /*
    |--------------------------------------------------------------------------
    | Enforce "notpwned" rule on backend users
    |--------------------------------------------------------------------------
    |
    | When this is enabled, the 'notpwned' validation rule is enforced on all
    | backend users by default. This means that they will not be able to update
    | their password to any password detected in a password breach, and if a
    | backend user tries to login with a "pwned" password, they will be rejected
    | and a password reset email will be sent to their email address for them to
    | change their password.
    */

    'enforceOnBackendUsers' => true,

];
```

## Overriding the validation message

To override the validation message, duplicate the plugin's `lang/en/lang.php` file to `project/lang/$locale/winter/pwnedpasswords/lang.php`.
